File System related calls:

Definitions:
MAX_PATH = 512 (defined as 4096 in kernel)
FILES_PER_PROCESS = 32

Helper Functions:
strncpy_from_user() /* wrapper around copyin like kernel */ copyinstr() exists

Data Structures used:

file_table: An array of pointers to the global_filetable_list
reference: currentThread -> process_structure-> file_table

global_filetable_list
reference: global data structure, init'd on boot
<Use lock to access the global data structure>

1. open():
args in: char *filename, int openflags, int mode
args out: file descriptor
Ignore mode for now. Pass 0 always.

Algorithm:
1. copyin() filename from userspace. Copy till null termination or till MAX_PATH
2. Check the process table file count if the user has exceeded the limit per process, if yes, exit with error
check the global filetable_list count, if the user has exceeded the no of global files, is yes, return error
3. Validate the path name, validate flags
4. Call vfs_open()
5. add a new node to global_filetable_list, make the vnode pointer of the node to point to the vnode 
pointer filled after vfs_open returns, if vfs_open() has an error, return
6. Find the smallest free index in file_table, point it to the newly created node in the global_filetable_list
7. make the open_count to 1, set the flags
8. If the file is opened for append, offset has to be at the end of file, if opened from read, it has to be at 0
(Call VOP_STAT() to the get the size of file and set the offset to that position)
9. return the index in file_table. This is the file descriptor

2. read():
args in: int fd, void* buf, int size
args out: no of bytes read

Algorithm:
1. Check if the fd passed has a entry in the process_file_table, if not return error
2. Get the file handle from the global_filetable_list <dereference the pointer pointed by process_file_table[fd]
3. Check if the file was opened with read perms, if not return error
4. Create uio structure with offset as value pointed in the file handle
5. Call VOP_READ() by passing uimove structure
6. Sit back and replax while VFS does the work
7. Advance the offset to the no of bytes read
8. Return the no of byte read

3. write():
args in: int fd, void* buf, int size
args out: no of bytes written

Algorithm:
1. Check if the fd passed has a entry in the process_file_table, if not return error
2. Get the file handle from the global_filetable_list <dereference the pointer pointed by process_file_table[fd]
3. Check if the file was opened with write permissions, if not return error
4. Create uimove structure with offset as value pointed in the file handle
5. Call VOP_WRITE() by passing uimove structure
6. Sit back and replax while VFS does the work
7. Advance the offset to the no of bytes written
8. Return the no of byte written

4. lseek()
@args in int fd 
	off_t pos
	int whence - 	SEEK_SET 
			SEEK_CUR
			SEEK_END 
Algorithm:
1. a0 has fd, a2/a3 has pos, read whence by doing a 4 byte copyin from (sp+16)
2. Check if the fd passed has a entry in the process_file_table, if not return error
3. Get the file handle from the global_filetable_list <dereference the pointer pointed by process_file_table[fd]
4. validate off_t by checking VOP_STAT(), fail for console devices
5. Set the offset in the file handle to whence+pos
 
5. close()
Algorithm:
1. Check if the fd passed has a entry in the process_file_table, if not return error
2. Get the file handle from the global_filetable_list <dereference the pointer pointed by process_file_table[fd]
3. Decrement the reference count in the file handle
4. If this was the last reference, call VOP_CLOSE()
5. Decrement the file_open count, delete the file handle node
6. Mark the file_table[fd] to NULL
7. return 
 
6. dup2()
Algorithm:
1. Validate old_fd and see if new_fd is not it use
2. Point the file_table[new_fd] to global file handle table
3. Increment the reference count in the global table by 1
4. Increment the process file count by 1 and return

7. chdir()
1. copyin the pathname
2. Direct call to vfs_chdir()
 
8. __getcwd()
1. Polulate uio struct
2. Call vfs_cwd()
