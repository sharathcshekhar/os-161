Process related system call Interface design

#define MAX_USER_PROCESSES 1024

Data Structures:

PROCESS TABLE:
The data structure is maintained in the kernel for each process and would have the below parameters:

1. Pointer to the thread_t structure
2. PID
3. File table indicating the no of files open and their file descriptors
4. Status of the process - is anyone waiting on this process or is it ready to run?
5. List of PIDs of the Children
6. PPID - Parent process ID

FILE TABLE:
1. This is data structure contains information about the files opened by the process
2. Each descriptor points to a file structure which has the present offset in the file

GLOBAL FILE TABLE: doubly linked list

Modification to existing Data Structures:
struct thread new entry to contain the process table

PID generation Mechanism: O(log n) algorithm for allocating PIDs
1. PIDs are allocated sequentially from 0 to MAX_USER_PROCESSES
2. Whether the PID is in use or not is maintained in bit map. Every time a new PID has to be allocated,
the bitmap is scanned and the lowest PID is allocated to the new process.
3. When the process exits, the PID is cleared from the bit map()

Algorithms for System calls

1. getpid():

1. return the pid by checking the process table

2. fork():

New files: syscall/fork.c:
Description: Implementation of kernel fork system call: sys_fork():

Files to edit:
In kern/arch/mips/syscall/syscall.c, add a new test case for fork, case 0: and call sys_fork(). 
No arguments are passed - Just call the function.

Algorithm of sys_fork():

1. Check if the process cont has exceeded the MAX_USER_PROCESS, if yes, return failure
2. Find a free pid to allocate to the newly created process
3. Spawn a kernel thread immediately to handle the new process - call thread_fork() and pass create_new_process()
// save the trap frame in the parent thread
4. Wait for a signal from the child thread to return back to user space.

5. In create_new_process():
	1. create a new process in the process table and add that to the thread->process
	2. Clone file table in the process table, set the PPID, set the child process table for the parent
	3. Create new address space by calling as_create(), reset the child TLB by calling as_activate()
	4. call as_copy() to create a copy of the existing address space
	5. Copy the trap frame
	6. define the user space stack by calling as_define_stack()
	7. set the entry point same as (program counter + 4)
	8. If no errors, set the newly allocated pid in a shared variable and 
	   signal the parent that it can go back to user space
	9. set the return value to 0 enter the user program by calling enter_new_process() //call mips_usermode()
	10. If any errors, set -1 in a shared variable, signal the waiting parent, destroy resources and call thread_exit() 
	
6. Set the return value to the pid of the child process in tf->tf_v0 and return

Synchronization:
1. The parent process should not go back to user mode until the trapframe has been copied to the child process
2. The child process should not enter user space until everything has been copied


3. execv()
@args in: char *program_name
	  char **args
1. copyin program_name and the entire **args
2. count the no of args and store it in argc
3. create a new address space usig as_create followed by as_activate
4. Open the file and check the executable permissions
5. Copy old address space thread->t_address_space to a tmp pointer
5. call load_elf() and load the new address space with the ELF values
6. on any failure, destory the new address space, and set the address space back to the old as
8. Push argc and argv to stack, se the trap frame 
9. return control to usermode
	  
@args out: Never returns

4. waitpid():

@args in: int PID - to wait on
	  int *status - status flag
	  int options - dummy
	  
@args out: PID of the returned process
		 			
1. Check if the PID is one of the children by accessing:
	curthread->process->children which will be a list of child
if not, return error
2. Check if the child has already exited by checking it's status
3. If yes, free the process table entry, file table, PID
4. If not, wait on the CV of the child process
5. When signaled, free the process table entries, file table, PID


5. _exit()
@args in: status
@args out: void

1. Close all open files
2. Mark the status as Zombie in the process table
3. Check if it has any children
4. If yes, assign its PPID as the PID for the children.
5. Assign all children to its grandfather by modyifying the process table entry
6. Set the exit code in the process table entry
7. Send death signal to its CV by calling cv_wakeone()
8. call thread_exit()
